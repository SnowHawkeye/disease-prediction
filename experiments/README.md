# Experiments
## Conventions
The folder structure should correspond to the issues structure, with the corresponding numbers.
This way, the issue corresponding to an experiment can be found easily.
For the same reason, it is also recommended to include the issue number even in "convenience" subfolders.

Example :

```
project_001_main_issue
└── ask_010_issue
    └── experiment_011_issue
        ├── convenient_folder_011
        │   └── experiment_script_011.py
        └── ...
```
